# CodSoft_Internship_Tasks
Hello everyone, this repository contains all the stuff that I've done during the #CodSoft DataScience Internship (Basically the tasks assigned to me)

This project leverages data science techniques to predict Titanic passenger survival. 
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models. 
The repository serves as a practical guide for applying data science methods to real-world datasets, with a focus on improving prediction accuracy and model optimization.

I hope my work will be a great help for you.....That's all for now, SEE YAA !!!
